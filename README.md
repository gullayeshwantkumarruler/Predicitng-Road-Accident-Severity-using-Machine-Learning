# Predicitng-Road-Accident-Severity-using-Machine-Learning

Objective:<br>
“To develop a predictive model to identify the factors that contribute to the severity of a vehicle
accident based on various features such as the number of vehicles involved, engine capacity, age of
vehicle, weather conditions, road surface conditions, urban or rural area, propulsion code, vehicle
maneuver, towing and articulation, skidding and overturning, and the first point of impact.”
The objective of this problem statement is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately
predict the severity of an accident based on the given features. The model can be used to identify
the contributing factors to the severity of accidents and help in developing strategies to reduce the
frequency and severity of accidents.
